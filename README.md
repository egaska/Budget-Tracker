## Description
A budget tracker that reacts as you add your transactions. You are able to add labeled transactions to keep track of your incoming and outgoing money.
The input is displayed in a table and a graph that updates as you add to it. Entries are stored in the MongoDB/NoSQL database to be accessed again at any time.
